Access state using this.state

Actions -> facts about what happened
Reducers -> update the state according to the actions
Stores -> bring actions and reducers together

Stores:
- stores are objects
- cannot access state directly, need to access it through getState
- dispatch is like setState, allows state to be updated
- subscribe(listener) -> after dispatch, will invoke whatever functions are passed in, works like an event listener responding to an onChange event
- can access state but not update it directly
- store is the interface to the state
  - pass an action using "dispatch" and it passes the action and currentState into the reducer

Reducers:
- define what the state can be and what its interactions can be
- use reducers to create a store
- lib directory exports the store
- reducer directory holds things that define the state and how to change the state


Actions can trigger multiple reducers, so make sure they are in their own folders

Reducer defines state and interactions, action creators return actions
